# Requirement-Ducument-Project-
This is a complete requirement document for the online system of a pet store called Kiki's and Cody's.
The system will be a combination of two worldwide using systems. 
The first one is the online shop system. Famous examples are Amazon, Costco, and Target's online stores. This kind of system supports features that include 
login, sign-in, sorting items, adding items in cart, check-out, filling billing and delivery information, check-out, manage inventory, etc. 

The second kind of system is the appointment-making system. Famous examples are doctor's appointments, COVID-19 vaccine appointments, and pet care 
appointments. This kind of system support features that include making appointments, in-store check-in, and check-out, etc. 

This requirement document will start with an introduction, and the opening will include the table of content. 

Note that this requirement document only specifies what to implement instead of how, so it will not include the implementation of the features in this 
requirement document. 
Note that this requirement document is not only for professional programmers, so the "Other Requirement" session will include a glossary of terms. 

I did score 100% on this requirement document assignment but noted that this is only a simple requirement document. An actual requirement document would 
be much longer and more specific.
